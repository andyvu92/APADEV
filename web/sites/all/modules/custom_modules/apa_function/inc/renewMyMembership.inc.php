	<li>Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed</li>
	<li>Not kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed</li>
	<li>Processed in a manner that ensures its security using appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage</li>
	<li>Not transferred to another country without appropriate safeguards being in place</li>
	<li>Made available to data subjects and allow data subjects to exercise certain rights in relation to their personal data</li>

Relevant information is disclosed to the public on the internet via the APA's 'Find a Physio' online searchable database only. You must approve the use of your details on this database. Whether you decide to use this service is your choice.</p>


<h4 class="doc-header">Security</h4>

<p>Your information is stored on the APA's server located in a secure data housing facility. While, it is important to recognise that 'perfect security' does not exist on the internet, the APA is committed to using industry standard mechanisms to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="doc-header">Credit Card Information</h4>

<p>The APA does not permanently store credit card information anywhere on this site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<h4 class="doc-header">APA Members Privacy</h4>

<p>The APA has a strong commitment to protecting your privacy and ensuring the confidentiality and security of personal information provided to the APA by you. As an organisation with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, the APA is required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 as amended by the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 which came into effect in March 2014.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You have the right to access the personal information about yourself held by the APA and to correct information which is inaccurate. To change your information you must log into your account with your member ID and password via the APA website <a href="https://australian.physio" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000">www.australian.physio</a>.</p>

<p>Information you have provided to the APA is used to:&nbsp;</p>

<h4>3. Membership cancellation and refund policies</h4>

<h4 class="doc-header">Instalment policy</h4>

<p>The first monthly instalment will be deducted upon receipt of renewal. The first instalment will include the full amount of GST payable for the year. It will also include any donations that you may have agreed to provide. Subsequent instalments for the year will equal the remaining amount due divided by the respective number of months of the year remaining. Monthly instalments will be deducted from your nominated credit or debit card on the first working day of the month. By electing to pay by instalments you are also opting to have your membership automatically rolled over into the forthcoming year, authorising the APA to continue deducting membership fees until you notify the APA in writing to cease deductions or your membership is cancelled or withdrawn and outstanding fees are collected. Instalments can only be cancelled in December at the end of our membership year. You will be notified in writing of any change to your deductions at least 30 days prior to that change. If there are insufficient funds available to make the deduction or the payment is rejected for other reasons, the APA may pass associated bank fees on to you.</p>

<h4 class="doc-header">Refund policy</h4>

<p>The Australian Physiotherapy Association will not issue membership refunds throughout the year unless under extraordinary circumstances. Applications for refund must be made in writing to the Senior Finance and Systems Officer. All applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis and the decision made will be final. Please note that membership to the APA is done on a yearly basis. If any refund of membership fees is granted the APA reserves its right to charge an administrative fee of $100.00 (inclusive of GST), which will be deducted before membership fees are refunded.</p>
